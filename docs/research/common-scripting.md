# Common Scripting Engines

- Status: **Confirmed** for the pinned 29-file inventory, 90-slot map-script and 80-slot entity-script
  dispatch tables, interpreter admission/termination rules, text-bank selection, Huffman state, and
  the regular entity map-sprite decode/DMA consumer shape
- Status: **Inferred** for named helper intent where only call structure is modeled
- Status: **Unknown** for caller-dependent story meaning, entity movement timing, text rendering timing,
  and individual script content
- Evidence date: 2026-07-19
- Source baseline: `ShiningForceCentral/SF2DISASM`

## Confirmed Inventory

The recursive `code/common/scripting` boundary contains 29 files, 11,153 source lines, 888 global
labels, and 576 direct call sites across entity, map, text, and end-credit helpers. Twenty-eight files
have a representative global symbol bound to the H1 listing. They now own 35 indexed findings: one
representative record per labeled file plus seven deeper map-setup records in shared scripting
sources. Record count and indexed-file count are intentionally separate denominators. The remaining
`text/unused_textfunctionsdata.asm` is exactly 288 `dc.b` directives over annotated ROM range
`$6D74..$6E94`; because it has no global label, it is verified by the H2 inventory but deliberately
excluded from strict symbol-based file reach.

## Confirmed Interpreters

`ExecuteMapScript` consumes word commands and ends on `$FFFF`. A negative command sleeps for its low
byte; P2 Start under debug mode sets the skip flag, bypassing dialogue and those sleep commands.
Nonnegative commands select one of 90 table slots. Eight slots route to the shared no-op target.
Return waits for outstanding view scroll when a dialogue window is open and clears view speed.

The entity VInt skips slots whose coordinate is at least `$7000` or whose actscript pointer is zero,
then dispatches the current word through an 80-slot table. It has 44 unique targets; 37 unused slots
advance directly to the next entity. This establishes table shape and dispatch behavior, not exact
movement duration or rendered sprite behavior.

`DisplayText` selects a text-bank pointer by `(stringIndex / 256) * 4`, uses the low byte within that
bank, reads a one-byte compressed-length prefix, and initializes a stateful Huffman decoder. Decoder
state begins with previous symbol `$FE`, chooses its tree from the previous decoded symbol, and
persists the bit barrel plus previous symbol across calls. Symbols `$EE` and above are control codes;
`$FE` terminates the string.

`ChangeEntityMapsprite` and `DmaEntityMapsprite` convert one regular map-sprite ID plus facing into
one of three pointers in `pt_Mapsprites`, call `LoadBasicCompressedData` into
`FF8002_LOADING_SPACE`, and DMA `0x120` words (`0x240` bytes) to the entity's VRAM slot. IDs 240-255
take the separate special-sprite route. The data contract confirms 669 valid streams of that exact
size, but IDs 237-239 share a raw `0xFFFF` placeholder even though they are below the route cutoff.
A complete symbolic scan finds no source references to those enums, but whether encoded values and
runtime writes exclude the three reserved IDs remains **Unknown** and is owned as one data-flow/
runtime question rather than inferred from name absence.

`map/mapsetupsfunctions_1.asm` and `map/mapfunctions.asm` now have deeper cross-subsystem contracts:
setup selection, six-pointer layout, entity/zone/item/description dispatcher shapes, all selected
entity record streams, the complete entity/zone/item event-table boundary, and all area-description
wrappers/tables, setup initialization callables, and standalone setup scripts are source/H1-verified by
[`map-data-inventory.md`](./map-data-inventory.md). This inventory still owns the file boundary and
general scripting engine; the map-data document owns setup-table semantics.

## Runtime Queue

Entity movement timing, dialogue typewriter/render timing, end-credit presentation, and contextual
meaning of script commands remain grouped runtime questions. They will share scenario setup and
observation buffers rather than becoming one emulator launch per opcode. Symbolic reference search
for reserved map-sprite IDs 237-250 is complete; encoded records and runtime writes are the remaining
static frontier before one shared entity-sprite matrix. This batch adds no emulator run.
