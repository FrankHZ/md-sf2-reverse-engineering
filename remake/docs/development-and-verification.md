# Remake Development and Verification

## Scope

This document owns current remake commands and verification selection. The user's test policy,
recorded in [ADR 0019](../../docs/decisions/0019-state-and-content-driven-remake-engine.md), controls
over older blanket gate and test-preservation recipes:

- Add small unit tests of actual new-engine behavior, with independent expected values and meaningful
  state/configuration variation. A small session using real reducers is a useful unit boundary.
- Reference comparisons, validation, probes, fixture drivers, planners, gates, reports and test helpers
  are themselves verification. Use them directly when needed; do not add tests of those programs.
- Migrate useful behavior assertions or retire obsolete tests with their owning capability. Test
  counts, a replacement for every deletion, and a green old aggregate are not acceptance targets.
- Documentation-only changes use direct link/anchor/fence/table/example, scope and private-boundary
  checks. They do not require a new normal/full, .NET, Godot or H3 run.

M1's engine unit project covers actual Domain/Application/Content behavior for two authored battle
packages, with scoped engine/adapter entries and public jobs. The native observation directly drives
the same session with Godot input and reads real state/HUD/nodes; it emits no images. Main-gate owns required-check configuration during integration; a candidate must report its
actual CI outcome and that configuration boundary explicitly.
[ADR 0012](../../docs/decisions/0012-dependency-aware-partitioned-verification.md) continues to own
affected research evidence selection. Shared research changes keep their separate owning requirements.

Godot acceptance observes the actual running instance: Application snapshots, commands, presenter
projections, node geometry/visibility/focus where relevant, and process errors. Screenshots, image
comparison and frame-inspection recipes are prohibited. Existing completed images remain historical
artifacts. A probe that still emits images needs that side effect disabled in an owned change before
a future required run. A remote debug server is not an established dependency; first use an existing
native probe or suitable debug/state interface that answers the concrete question.

Reuse the same verified Godot installation, owning project and running debug instance. A concrete
failure, necessary code/import restart, observed contamination, or test of startup/export/cleanup can
justify a bounded restart or isolated instance; record the reason. A new slice or comparison does not
justify copying the project, extracting another editor, or building a debug framework.

## Locked .NET Workflow

Load the existing ignored host/worktree environment before every SDK command, including informational
commands. Select one existing absolute `DOTNET_BIN` and one absolute `DOTNET_CLI_HOME` shared by this
project's worktrees. Force `DOTNET_ADD_GLOBAL_TOOLS_TO_PATH=false` at the actual child launch.
The maintained entrypoints reject missing/relative selections. No launch may change registry PATH.

The SDK otherwise adds its tools directory by default; a new CLI home can repeat first-run setup.
`DOTNET_SKIP_FIRST_TIME_EXPERIENCE` does not supply the PATH protection. The
[official variable reference](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/tools/dotnet-environment-variables#dotnet_add_global_tools_to_path)
owns that SDK behavior. Use the SDK pinned by [global.json](../global.json); do not install another one
to configure sharing or make a check pass. Keep NuGet packages/HTTP cache worktree-local, outside the
shared CLI home, and preserve the tracked package versions and locks.

For an affected current product project, run from `remake/` after that setup. For example, when
Domain itself is affected, select its existing project explicitly:

```powershell
$env:DOTNET_ADD_GLOBAL_TOOLS_TO_PATH = 'false'
$project = 'src/Sf2.Remake.Domain/Sf2.Remake.Domain.csproj'
& $env:DOTNET_BIN restore $project --locked-mode
& $env:DOTNET_BIN build $project --configuration Release --no-restore
```

From the repository root after loading that environment, the maintained entries are:

```powershell
uv run sf2 verify engine
uv run sf2 verify adapter
```

`verify engine` restores in locked mode, builds and tests
`remake/tests/Sf2.Remake.Engine.Tests/Sf2.Remake.Engine.Tests.csproj`; it references production
Domain/Application/Content and copies the actual `remake/content/authored/*.json` inputs.
`verify adapter` restores in locked mode and builds `remake/game/Sf2.Remake.Godot.csproj` without tests
or native Godot. Both launch the selected executable from `remake/`, honoring `global.json` and the
protected environment. Neither needs private inputs. The engine project is selected directly;
the current `Sf2.Remake.sln` still includes four production and four legacy test projects.
Whole-solution commands remain available for an explicitly applicable legacy/release check, not every
engine or documentation change. Use formatting only for affected product projects when needed.

## Authored Battle Observation

After loading the existing worktree environment, build the actual Debug assembly once when needed
by the existing Godot instance. Release adapter verification alone does not refresh Godot's Debug DLL.
From `remake/`:

```powershell
$env:DOTNET_ADD_GLOBAL_TOOLS_TO_PATH = 'false'
& $env:DOTNET_BIN build game/Sf2.Remake.Godot.csproj --configuration Debug --no-restore
```

No-argument local Godot startup opens the authored yard. To select either real package, use the
existing verified Godot executable with `--path remake/game -- --authored-package <package-path>`.
Input is WASD/arrows for preview, Enter for action choice/commit, H for the known HEAL with self
initially selected, Tab for living allied targets, Space for STAY and Escape for cancel. Physical attack selection is X; Tab then selects living opponents. Packages without physical
definitions report Unsupported. Application runs AI and rounds automatically.

Tab cycles from the last attempted UI candidate, including a rejected one. A range rejection preserves
the session's accepted target and battle state; subsequent Tab input can reach later living targets of the selected action. The HUD
shows both attempted and accepted target after rejection. Cancel or the next action clears the UI cursor.
The map viewport keeps the acting origin, preview and target visible with clipping/pan/zoom. Wide
windows place a scrollable HUD beside the map; narrow windows place it below. Authored UI uses actual
window dimensions, while the legacy reference path retains its original window policy.

From the repository root, the direct observation command is:

```powershell
$packageName = 'practice-yard' # or garden-watch
$packagePath = (Resolve-Path -LiteralPath "remake/content/authored/$packageName.json").Path
$outputPath = Join-Path $env:SF2_RUN_OUTPUT 'observation.json'
& $godotBinary --headless --path remake/game --script res://probes/engine_battle_observation.gd -- --authored-package $packagePath --observation-output $outputPath
```

`$godotBinary` is the already verified local installation, and `SF2_RUN_OUTPUT` is an explicit ignored
worktree-local destination from the existing environment. Run packages serially in that same project;
their startup selection is the concrete reason for separate observation processes. The script injects
real `InputEventKey` events, reads the common session result and actual HUD/node geometry/visibility,
checks cancellation, HEAL/STAY, carried RNG and automatic progression, and exits nonzero on failure.
Its JSON/log output is local generated evidence; it never emits images or modifies session state.
No tests of this observation script are required.

For the connected physical chain use the same installation/project and an ignored output directory:

```powershell
$packagePath = (Resolve-Path -LiteralPath 'remake/content/authored/stone-court.json').Path
$outputPath = Join-Path $env:SF2_RUN_OUTPUT 'physical.json'
& $godotBinary --headless --path remake/game --script res://probes/engine_battle_observation.gd -- --authored-package $packagePath --observation-case physical --observation-output $outputPath
```

Repeat with `river-post.json`; `--reverse-kills` selects the opposite legal kill order. The observation
uses actual X/Tab/Enter/Space input, including a rejected distant target followed by a valid target,
then checks exact carried RNG/resources, removed coordinates/nodes, next living control and the next
round. All four package/order combinations use common product commands. Reached unsupported
level/leader/outcome atomicity and independent arithmetic expectations belong to
`PhysicalBattleTests`, not tests of this observer. Selected existing reference comparisons for the
shared scalar extraction are `SourceArithmeticKeepsZeroIntermediateAndBothDownwardDrawsAtTheOriginalRange`,
`MissAndCriticalUseRealSeedsAndPreserveSourceCallOrder`, `RealSeedsExerciseMissCriticalAndIndependentExpVariance`
and `KillAccountingUsesSourceCapsAndKeepsUnknownInputsUnknown` in the legacy Domain test project.
For shared counter/reward changes also select `CounterReversesRolesAndCommitsPrimaryThenCounterAndExpAsOneEnemyReceipt`,
`CounterHalvesBeforeSpreadAndConsumesItsOwnFlagsWithoutAnotherAttack` and
`PostHealBowieCounterUsesItsOwnPermissionAndOneEnemyReceipt`; run
those methods with a `dotnet test --filter` expression when their shared calculation changes. They
are bounded existing comparisons, not a new full legacy/H3 obligation.

For follow-up observation create one supported variant in the existing ignored output directory.
The four shapes use `stone-court` with initial high seed73 for `sticky`/`second-death`, seed55 for
`ally-death`, and `river-post` with seed55 for `counter`. All use low seed word0x1234, unchanged
placements and Stay AI. This is controlled startup input; the running session is never reseeded.

```powershell
$shape = 'sticky' # counter, ally-death, second-death
$packageName = if ($shape -eq 'counter') { 'river-post' } else { 'stone-court' }
$initialSeed = if ($shape -in @('sticky', 'second-death')) { 73 } else { 55 }
$data = Get-Content -Raw -LiteralPath "remake/content/authored/$packageName.json" | ConvertFrom-Json -AsHashtable
$data.start.mainSeed = [uint32]($initialSeed * 65536 + 4660)
foreach ($index in @(0, 2)) { $data.actors[$index].hp = 500; $data.actors[$index].maxHp = 500 }
$data.actors[2].attack = if ($shape -eq 'counter') { 26 } else { 18 }
if ($shape -eq 'ally-death') {
    $data.actors[0].hp = 1; $data.actors[0].exp = 99; $data.actors[0].physical.defeats = 6
}
if ($shape -eq 'second-death') { $data.actors[2].hp = 35 }
$packagePath = Join-Path $env:SF2_RUN_OUTPUT 'package.json'
$data | ConvertTo-Json -Depth 20 | Set-Content -LiteralPath $packagePath -Encoding utf8NoBOM
$outputPath = Join-Path $env:SF2_RUN_OUTPUT 'followups.json'
& $godotBinary --headless --path remake/game --script res://probes/engine_battle_observation.gd -- --authored-package $packagePath --observation-case followups --followup-shape $shape --observation-output $outputPath
```

Use a fresh output directory per shape and run serially in the same installed project. The observer
presses actual Enter/X/Tab/Space, checks Actor/Target reversal and ordered first/second/counter
observations, exact draw count/seed/resources, death visibility/accounting and subsequent control.
The ally-death shape checks that EXP99 stays99 and no award draws occur. The second-death shape
checks cancellation of the first hit's already-set counter. The observer is executed directly,
without tests of the observer or helper.

The same direct script also accepts `--observation-case target-cycle` and `--observation-case layout`.
It sets a representative 960×540 host window because a headless SceneTree script otherwise starts a
64×64 physical window. The layout case resizes the actual window to 640×480 and 1280×720, checks real
map/HUD and actor/preview rectangles, scrolls the HUD with real mouse-wheel events and commits movement
with real keys. `--long-path` additionally traverses a valid long preview before that observation.

Prepare minimal public authored variants in a fresh ignored output directory, without editing packages:

```powershell
$caseDirectory = Join-Path $env:SF2_RUN_OUTPUT 'inputs'
New-Item -ItemType Directory -Path $caseDirectory | Out-Null
$cycle = Get-Content -LiteralPath 'remake/content/authored/practice-yard.json' -Raw | ConvertFrom-Json
$laterAlly = $cycle.actors[1] | ConvertTo-Json -Depth 8 | ConvertFrom-Json
$laterAlly.id = 'guard-c'
$laterAlly.slot = 10
$laterAlly.agility = 1
$cycle.actors += $laterAlly
$cycle.encounters[0].placements += [pscustomobject]@{actor='guard-c'; x=3; y=4}
$cycle | ConvertTo-Json -Depth 15 | Set-Content -LiteralPath (Join-Path $caseDirectory 'three-allies.json') -Encoding utf8NoBOM
$layout = Get-Content -LiteralPath 'remake/content/authored/practice-yard.json' -Raw | ConvertFrom-Json
$layout.terrains[0].rows = @(1..48 | ForEach-Object { '1' * 48 })
$layout.actors[0].move = 255
$layout.encounters[0].placements[0].x = 47
$layout | ConvertTo-Json -Depth 15 | Set-Content -LiteralPath (Join-Path $caseDirectory 'full-square.json') -Encoding utf8NoBOM
```

Use those respective paths with `--authored-package`, the selected observation case and a fresh
`--observation-output`. The targeting variant places the rejected ally before a legal adjacent ally;
the layout variant spans both admitted dimensions. Both execute the same production session and view,
with no runtime seed/state injection. Preserve original failed observations and run only the affected
case after a correction; adapter-only fixes do not require replaying unchanged engine/reference suites.

Private trust remains in the transitional reference reader until its capability migrates. Its affected
direct comparison is the existing `PrivateCanonicalMap3ImportReaderTests.UnknownShapeAndProvenanceDriftFailClosed`
case, selected alone from the Content.Tests project; it passes after relocation without selecting the
old aggregate or adding a dependency from Engine.Tests to Reference. Do not turn this selected reference
check into an automatic legacy-suite obligation for every new engine change.
The extracted weighted rule also retains the selected Domain.Tests
`Battle01PlayerMovementTests.WeightedPropagationMatchesTheAcceptedRuntimeMatrix` comparison, including
its flat-row and bucket-wrap cases. It passes through the reference wrapper; the authored engine's
logical row-edge behavior has its own actual movement unit assertion. No original fixture changed.

### Enemy action observation

The enemy branch uses the same reader, session and existing native observer. Start from either
physical package and prepare this controlled input in an ignored worktree-local output directory:

```powershell
$packageName = 'stone-court' # river-post also supports the counter shape
$shape = 'counter' # movement, enemy-death, unsupported use stone-court
$data = Get-Content -Raw -LiteralPath "remake/content/authored/$packageName.json" | ConvertFrom-Json -AsHashtable
$data.start.mainSeed = [uint32](55 * 65536 + 4660)
foreach ($index in @(0, 2)) {
    $data.actors[$index].hp = 500
    $data.actors[$index].maxHp = 500
    $data.actors[$index].defense = 4
}
$data.actors[0].attack = 18
$data.actors[0].physical.prowess = 0
$data.actors[2].attack = 30
$data.actors[2].physical.prowess = 3
$data.actors[2].controller = 'attack1-script3'
$data.actors[2].move = 1
if ($shape -eq 'movement') {
    $data.actors[2].move = 3
    $data.encounters[0].placements[2].x = 7
    $data.encounters[0].placements[3].x = 6
    $data.encounters[0].placements[3].y = 5
}
if ($shape -in @('enemy-death', 'unsupported')) { $data.actors[2].hp = 1 }
if ($shape -eq 'unsupported') { $data.actors[0].exp = 99 }
$packagePath = Join-Path $env:SF2_RUN_OUTPUT 'enemy-input.json'
$data | ConvertTo-Json -Depth 16 | Set-Content -LiteralPath $packagePath -Encoding utf8NoBOM
$outputPath = Join-Path $env:SF2_RUN_OUTPUT 'enemy-observation.json'
& $godotBinary --headless --path remake/game --script res://probes/engine_battle_observation.gd -- --authored-package $packagePath --observation-case enemy-actions --enemy-shape $shape --observation-output $outputPath
```

The four checkpoints cover initial state, real player STAY selection, automatic enemy action and
stable next control/Unsupported. The counter hits the ally for22 and the enemy for7, awards the
ally1 EXP, and carries main0x557E1234/thinking0x02EF0042. Counter kill instead awards24 EXP and19 gold,
removes the enemy node and ends at main0xB1BC1234. The late level-up shape preserves all enemy-action
state while retaining the preceding player's committed turn. Movement chooses (4,3) from (7,3).
These are reference expectations for the supplied configurations, never production dispatch rules.
Inspect native logs for script/process errors and require all four checkpoints, as well as the
reported pass and exit status; a script that stops before its final checkpoint is incomplete.

`EnemyActionTests` owns independent behavior checks for changed targets/configurations, continued
history, dead secondary queue entries, automatic startup and per-enemy failure boundaries. For the
shared thinking calculation, select existing reference methods
`SignedRangeBoundariesStillAdvanceTheHighByteOnce` and `HighByteSignedEdgesMatchTheExistingThinkingHelper`.
`ScriptThreeAndSelectionRetainLethalityBranchClassCohortAndMovementTieOrder` and the affected scalar/
counter methods above retain the existing source comparison. No new H3 or legacy aggregate is required.

### Multi-target selection observation

Use the same installed editor, project and fresh ignored output with competing configured actors:

```powershell
$packageName = 'stone-court' # river-post also supports secondary
$shape = 'secondary' # primary, movement, missing-class use stone-court
$data = Get-Content -Raw -LiteralPath "remake/content/authored/$packageName.json" | ConvertFrom-Json -AsHashtable
$data.start.mainSeed = [uint32](55 * 65536 + 4660)
$data.start.thinkingSeed = [uint32]0x00EF0042
foreach ($index in @(0, 1, 2)) {
    $data.actors[$index].hp = 500
    $data.actors[$index].maxHp = 500
    $data.actors[$index].defense = 4
    $data.actors[$index].attack = if ($index -eq 2) { 30 } else { 18 }
    $data.actors[$index].physical.prowess = if ($index -eq 2) { 3 } else { 0 }
}
$data.actors[0].classRule = if ($shape -eq 'primary') { 'unpromoted-swordsman' } else { 'unpromoted-warrior' }
$data.actors[1].classRule = if ($shape -eq 'primary') { 'unpromoted-warrior' } else { 'unpromoted-swordsman' }
$data.actors[2].controller = 'attack1-script3'
$data.actors[2].move = 1
$data.encounters[0].placements[1].x = $data.encounters[0].placements[2].x - 1
$data.encounters[0].placements[1].y = $data.encounters[0].placements[2].y
if ($shape -eq 'movement') {
    $data.actors[0].classRule = 'ordinary'
    $data.actors[1].classRule = 'ordinary'
    $data.actors[2].move = 8
    $data.encounters[0].placements[0].x = 1; $data.encounters[0].placements[0].y = 1
    $data.encounters[0].placements[1].x = 1; $data.encounters[0].placements[1].y = 4
    $data.encounters[0].placements[2].x = 7; $data.encounters[0].placements[2].y = 3
}
if ($shape -eq 'missing-class') { $data.actors[0].classRule = 'ordinary' }
$packagePath = Join-Path $env:SF2_RUN_OUTPUT 'targets-input.json'
$data | ConvertTo-Json -Depth 16 | Set-Content -LiteralPath $packagePath -Encoding utf8NoBOM
$outputPath = Join-Path $env:SF2_RUN_OUTPUT 'targets-observation.json'
& $godotBinary --headless --path remake/game --script res://probes/engine_battle_observation.gd -- --authored-package $packagePath --observation-case target-selection --target-shape $shape --observation-output $outputPath
```

Both adjacent candidates consume thinking draws in reverse slot order: 1 then2 produce raw19 each,
reported cap15, so changing only the class definitions changes the chosen actor. The movement shape
has costs12/14 and priority1, selecting the farther target without requiring class metadata. Each
successful shape has five checkpoints through actual player commands into round2: main RNG carries
0x557E1234 → 0x97231234 → 0xE0E11234, thinking carries0x02EF0042 → 0x01EF0042, and the second enemy
action selects the primary actor from the evolving candidates. Missing class in the critical cohort
has four checkpoints and preserves the entire failed enemy action. Require the exact checkpoint
count, clean logs and successful result. JSON numbers are floats in GDScript; nested expected numeric
arrays must preserve that representation rather than failing an otherwise equal observed value.

`TargetSelectionTests` owns actual rule/content/session expectations, including raw/capped and
signed-byte edges, class tables, same-class/equal-movement ties, reordered configuration/slots and
atomic missing-data/late-settlement rejection. Direct affected reference selections are
`ScriptThreeAndSelectionRetainLethalityBranchClassCohortAndMovementTieOrder`,
`ActualRoundSixAttackReplaysHpOnceAndAdvancesToBowieWithAllRandomChannels`,
`ActualRoundEightChesterHitReplaysTheSelectedProfileAndPreservesFirstDefeatAccounting`,
`DamagedEnemyAfterChesterAttackSelectsBowieAndPreservesEarnedExp`,
`CounterReversesRolesAndCommitsPrimaryThenCounterAndExpAsOneEnemyReceipt` and
`PostHealBowieCounterUsesItsOwnPermissionAndOneEnemyReceipt`. These execute the retained real ranking
consumers through the shared selector; no reference runner or native-probe tests are added.

## Optional Private .NET Checks

Existing legacy checks use xUnit's explicit private-input selection. This is their current command
contract, not a retention obligation for every method during engine migration.

| Existing check family | Required selections when that check is actually needed |
| --- | --- |
| Canonical import | `SF2_PRIVATE_CANONICAL_MAP_IMPORT` |
| Original map visual payload | `SF2_PRIVATE_ROM`, `SF2_PRIVATE_MAP_TILESET_METADATA`, `SF2_PRIVATE_MAP_PALETTE_METADATA` |
| Local presentation catalog/atlas | `SF2_PRIVATE_PRESENTATION_ASSET_ROOT`; canonical import where the projection consumes it |
| Battle01 startup | `SF2_PRIVATE_BATTLE01_DATA`, `SF2_PRIVATE_BATTLE01_SCENE`, `SF2_PRIVATE_BATTLE01_TERRAIN`; canonical import for connected session checks |

With no selected inputs, an optional check reports **skipped / no private assertions ran**. Partial
selection fails. For a required check set `SF2_REQUIRE_PRIVATE_TESTS=1` before discovery; missing inputs
then fail. `--filter` does not opt into private execution and other switch values do not require it.
Select the actual owning method/project, scope variables to that run and keep logs/output local.
Do not interpret public success with private skips as private acceptance.

[Local Private Inputs](../../docs/operations/local-private-inputs.md) owns registered read-only input
selection. Load it in the same process as any command that needs those inputs. Check the configured
shared ROM and its narrow identity command before reporting it missing; keep configuration, missing
input, identity mismatch, and later upstream/toolchain failure distinct. No copied input is required
solely to repair the appearance of an aggregate result.

## Selected Battle01 Startup Inputs

The current legacy reader consumes the selected Battle01 data and scene JSON exports plus compressed
terrain. Their exact identities remain in [battle01-data](../../manifests/extractions/battle01-data.json),
[battle01-scene](../../manifests/extractions/battle01-scene.json), and the existing Content reader.
These transport identities describe current fixed reference admission; they are not the proposed
general authored-content schema or a gameplay legality condition.

Reuse accepted exports read-only after checking identity. If the owning task actually needs to
reproduce them, the existing `scripts/Export-Battle01Data.ps1` and `Export-Battle01Scene.ps1` consume
the pinned upstream and explicit ignored destinations. New maintained tooling still belongs in
`src/sf2tool/`; this is a frozen compatibility route, not permission to add more PowerShell rails.

The [Map 3 implementation/reference record](./map03-playability-plan.md) retains selected inputs,
exact control histories, source-derived expectations, test method names and completed failures.
Use the named seam needed by a comparison. Its historical instructions to replay prefixes, preserve
every refusal, run full managed suites or inspect frame totals are not current engine acceptance rules.
Fixed traces remain external comparison data; obsolete trace guards and their tests can retire through
the separately owned engine migration. Preserve original H2/H3 goldens and their provenance.

## Repository Planner

On a clean committed head, inspect current selection without executing gates:

```powershell
uv run sf2 verify plan --base origin/main --head HEAD
```

The [planner](../../src/sf2tool/verification_plan.py) automatically selects `engine-unit` and/or
`adapter-build` for remake product/test paths, without the old solution or always-run `public-core`.
Non-research documentation and retired engine-test paths add no execution. Engine test changes select
unit tests; adapter changes select compilation; shared product/build inputs select both.

Shared CLI/harness/planner changes retain conservative research selection by default. For a declared
engine-only wiring change in those three shared modules, inspect the actual diff and use:

```powershell
uv run sf2 verify plan --scope engine --base origin/main --head HEAD
```

That explicit scope adds `research-public` direct lint/traceability/index checks for the wiring and
rejects research artifacts or other shared inputs. Path admission cannot detect a semantic research
change inside an allowed module: such a change must retain its research plan/dependency. Unknown
research paths keep conservative fanout. Retired verification tests do not fall back to the old suite.

The existing normal `uv run sf2 verify` command still performs its public stages followed by selected
private identity/provenance stages. It remains the research lane's normal route under its owner.
It is not a new-engine or documentation-only default. Preserve completed stage results and failures;
do not rerun it just to replace a known upstream-availability failure with green.

`uv run sf2 verify --full` remains exceptional for an applicable research milestone, materially shared
evidence-harness change, release boundary, or explicit full-parity request. An ordinary engine slice
does not inherit it. Test/gate wall time and earlier SHA changes do not by themselves invalidate results.

## Local Official Godot Gate

The existing runner is still available for an actually affected import, source/export execution or
process-lifecycle boundary:

```powershell
uv run python -m sf2tool.remake_godot
```

Current behavior: it verifies [toolchain.json](../toolchain.json), creates editor/template and project
scratch, performs locked restore/build, imports, runs source smoke, exports, runs exported smoke,
checks the output boundary and reaps its owned processes. Explicit `--toolchain-root`,
`--scratch-parent`, `--manifest-path` and `--project-path` remain available. This runner has not been
changed into a reusable live-debug session by the documentation audit.

Select it only when that particular lifecycle contract is needed. Repeated behavior observations use
the existing installation/project/instance instead; running this scratch-producing pipeline for each
check would violate the reuse policy. Any future runner change is separately owned and verified by
the needed actual launch, without new tests of the runner. Public CI does not launch native Godot.

## Private-Local Smoke Routing

An applicable private observation explicitly selects `private-local`, canonical/content inputs and
the needed mode. It uses the actual affected assembly, a bounded process owner, and checks relevant
session/input/state, errors, exit and cleanup. Private user arguments retain the existing exact
`--name=value` form after Godot's separator; diagnostics do not print private paths.

Reuse sufficient completed observations. A future probe run must follow Scope, including suppressing
image output; the older [native recipe](./presentation-and-assets.md#diagnostic-battle01-launch-and-native-review)
is retained for legacy argument/provenance lookup, not permission to replay its frame checklist.
Do not weaken Content trust or bypass the real Application path to make an observation pass.
Never delete a retained wrapper or failure artifact merely because its run ended.

## GitHub Public

Current [public-checks.yml](../../.github/workflows/public-checks.yml) remains triggered on every pull
request and main push. Its Windows jobs are:

| Job | Current execution |
| --- | --- |
| `scope` | Compare the actual event Git range; fail on a missing/invalid range or failed comparison. Emit the three affected-path booleans. |
| `engine-unit` | Locked restore/build/test of Engine.Tests and its actual production dependencies, using the pinned .NET SDK/runtime. No Python, native Godot, private input or legacy test project. |
| `adapter-build` | Locked restore/build of the actual Godot C# project; no old Godot tests or native editor launch. |
| `research-public` | Locked Python/uv dependencies, Ruff, direct design-contract traceability and research-index checks. No engine or verification-tool pytest families. |

Product/build inputs select engine and adapter; engine tests select engine; `remake/game/` selects
adapter. Research/contracts/source/fixtures/manifests/schema inputs select research. Workflow and
shared CLI/harness/planner changes select all three. Non-research documentation and legacy remake
test edits select no product jobs. Other non-remake inputs conservatively select research. The full
predicate lives in the workflow; add a genuinely consumed external unit input when that dependency
is introduced. M1's consumed authored JSON lives under `remake/content/`, which already selects both product jobs.

Main-gate has configured required `scope`, `engine-unit`, `adapter-build`, and `research-public`
checks with strict branch protection. Verify the actual candidate CI/check state at integration;
changing configuration remains main-gate authority. Path-irrelevant jobs report skipped; applicable jobs need a
real successful result. Review the diff and first applicable CI outcome directly, without tests of
job selection, workflow text or the migration. Research/private protections remain independently owned.

## Process, Path, and Artifact Safety

### Worktree Environment and Run Evidence

Reuse the dedicated isolated worktree after its previous topic is merged, tracked state is clean and
owned processes are settled. Start the next topic at accepted main in that worktree. Separate writers
and a specifically required reproduction environment justify another worktree; a slice number does not.

| State | Lifetime |
| --- | --- |
| Python environment and uv cache | Reuse worktree-local `UV_PROJECT_ENVIRONMENT` and `UV_CACHE_DIR`; sync the lock only when needed. |
| NuGet packages and HTTP cache | Reuse worktree-local selections; only SDK-owned CLI state is shared. |
| .NET CLI | Existing absolute `DOTNET_BIN`, shared absolute `DOTNET_CLI_HOME`, forced PATH opt-out at every controlled launch. |
| Godot | Existing verified installation/project/debug instance unless a concrete exception applies. |
| Outputs | Separate logs, receipts and failure evidence for actual new runs; reuse build/import state unless that state is the reason for isolation. |

Keep configuration in the existing ignored worktree environment script. Historical per-slice
launchers are evidence, not current environment setup. No user/machine PATH edits, populated-cache
copies, or environment installation merely because a topic changes. Registered immutable inputs keep
their read-only selection rules. Writable emulator/import/export state stays with its owner.

Use argument lists, bounded timeouts and owned process-tree cleanup. Inspect actual errors as well as
exit status. A zero-exit process or source-only reading does not prove a running adapter observation.
Preserve the first failure and its node/command IDs, logs and process-completion state; after a
correction run only affected engine behavior or directly invalidated verification. No full rerun
solely to replace a completed red aggregate, and no timeout increase as the first fix.

Cleanup is separately authorized work: inspect live references/processes and exact paths, record the
delete/retain list, and preserve private inputs, completed evidence and required reproduction state.
Do not replay earlier cleanup scripts. Keep private/generated inputs, tools, `.godot/`, `bin/`, `obj/`,
exports and receipts out of Git; inspect staged paths and any actually produced export boundary.

## Proportional Gate Guide

| Change | Required kind of evidence |
| --- | --- |
| New-engine rule/state/content behavior | Small meaningful engine unit tests; affected product build; direct reference comparison only for its affected claim |
| Godot input/presentation | Affected adapter build and needed actual-instance observation; no new probe/helper tests or screenshots |
| Verification/probe/planner/report code | Execute and inspect the needed verification directly; add no tests of verification infrastructure |
| Documentation/instructions | Direct document and scope checks, committed planner inspection, honest existing CI outcome |
| Original research or genuinely shared evidence input | Owning research requirements and affected dependencies; keep original evidence/provenance intact |

These scope rules do not waive accepted 8C/H4 evidence. A migration handoff names any pending remote
required-check change and unsupported product capability. Use
[Bounded Inspection and Review](../../docs/operations/bounded-inspection-and-review.md) for exact
identity, semantic review and completed-result handoff.
