# Host and Input Verification

Startup, logical input and accessibility checks observe the actual ordinary Godot host.

Load the owning worktree's private-input configuration and protected SDK/Godot environment from
[development](../development-and-verification.md#locked-net-workflow) in the same launching process.
Unless a recipe explicitly changes directory, commands run from the repository root. Reuse the
existing instance when suitable and choose fresh ignored outputs. These are focused recipes, not
an aggregate checklist. No screenshots; no new tests of probes/helpers. Read completed failure and
Unknown boundaries before reproducing a claim. Full historical receipts remain in the
[pre-reorganization guide](https://github.com/FrankHZ/md-sf2-reverse-engineering/blob/1c4c786a6e2c630e1cfadf4daa88dbd7687caa19/remake/docs/development-and-verification.md).

## Ordinary Host Startup

After loading the retained worktree SDK/Godot environment, ordinary play uses:

```powershell
& $godotBinary --path remake/game
& $godotBinary --path remake/game -- --authored-package (Resolve-Path -LiteralPath 'remake/content/authored/garden-watch.json').Path
```

The same project accepts `--private-battle-start` and `--private-exploration-start` with the selected private inputs described below. These and `--authored-package` select mutually exclusive session entries.
An optional `--input-settings <path>` selects the versioned product settings below, independently of
the entry and in either argument order. Each option takes one path and may appear only once.
Unknown/positional, duplicate, conflicting entry and missing-path arguments report
startup ContentError in the common view before creating a session. They cannot select legacy play.

The external observer owns `SF2_OBSERVATION_CASE`, `OUTPUT`, `FOLLOWUP_SHAPE`, `TARGET_SHAPE`,
`ENEMY_SHAPE`, `CONTINUATION_SHAPE`, `LONG_PATH` and `REVERSE_KILLS` (all with the same prefix).
Unset/empty CASE runs the default observation; flags use1. Former `--observation-*`/shape options are
not game arguments. Each example assigns its case/output; optional shapes belong to that named case.
Diagnostics do not affect ordinary launches without the script. Direct startup observation uses:

```powershell
$env:SF2_OBSERVATION_CASE = 'startup'
$env:SF2_OBSERVATION_EXPECT_FAILURE = ''
$env:SF2_OBSERVATION_EXPECT_ORIGIN = 'public-authored-controlled-start'
$env:SF2_OBSERVATION_OUTPUT = Join-Path $env:SF2_RUN_OUTPUT 'startup.json'
& $godotBinary --headless --path remake/game --script res://probes/engine_battle_observation.gd
```

For a rejected real-argument launch, set EXPECT_FAILURE to `unknown-startup-option`,
`duplicate-startup-option`, `conflicting-startup-options` or `missing-startup-path` and append the
corresponding arguments after Godot’s `--`. Private success uses EXPECT_ORIGIN
`private-local-controlled-start`. The script observes actual Main/GameRoot/BattleSessionView and
published startup state; it does not set engine state. Preserve process output and require passed:true.

The legacy `remake/reference/game` host, its `--map3-smoke`/profile arguments and their observations
were retired at M5. Ordinary export configuration excludes `probes/*`; complete ordinary export and
package contents remain unverified.

## Logical Input and Accessibility (ADR 0010 9A)

`GameRoot` loads one `InputSettings`/`GameInput` owner before starting a session, installs its
`sf2_*` Godot InputMap actions, and dispatches each physical event once to the current view.
Exploration, dialogue/choice, battle and return use the same semantic actions. Defaults are:

| Action identity | Keyboard keys | Standard gamepad buttons / axes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `up` | Up, W | DpadUp, LeftY- |
| `right` | Right, D | DpadRight, LeftX+ |
| `down` | Down, S | DpadDown, LeftY+ |
| `left` | Left, A | DpadLeft, LeftX- |
| `confirm` | Enter, KpEnter, Z | South |
| `cancel` | Escape, X | East |
| `attack` | F | West |
| `spell` | H | North |
| `item` | I | Back |
| `target` | Tab | RightShoulder |
| `stay` | Space | LeftShoulder |

Confirm talks, acknowledges dialogue, answers Yes, or selects/commits in battle. Cancel answers No
or cancels battle provisional choices; it does not acknowledge dialogue. Spell cycles learned spells
and levels with self as the initial target. Item selects and cycles carried item slots, initially
targeting self; Target cycles living candidates for the selected action.
All accepted commands still use Application's existing legality and state. F replaces the former X
attack binding; former C/Y/N exploration shortcuts are replaced by Confirm/Cancel. View help and
spell/item hints read effective bindings, including after a convention swap.

Keyboard echo is ignored. A stick deflection crossing magnitude0.5 submits one action; it must return
below that threshold or change sign to submit another. Unrelated axes and releases cannot repeat a
held direction. All standard Godot-mapped gamepads are accepted. This is product input behavior,
not a claim about original hardware scancodes or repeat cadence; physical controller-driver mapping
and hot-plug behavior are outside the injected native-event observations.

For example, save this UTF-8 JSON in a local settings file and pass its absolute path:

```json
{
  "formatVersion": 1,
  "confirmCancel": "swapped",
  "reducedFlash": true,
  "textMode": "adjustable",
  "charactersPerSecond": 40,
  "bindings": {
    "attack": { "keys": ["R"], "buttons": ["West"], "axes": [] }
  }
}
```

```powershell
& $godotBinary --path remake/game -- --input-settings $settingsPath
```

`formatVersion` is required and currently1. Other fields default to `standard`, false, `instant`,
40 and an empty binding override map. `confirmCancel` accepts `standard` or `swapped`; swapping
exchanges the **whole effective Confirm and Cancel binding sets after overrides**, across both
keyboard and gamepad, without changing their semantic roles. `textMode` accepts `instant` or
`adjustable`; `charactersPerSecond` must be finite in1–240 even in instant mode.

Each binding override replaces one complete action and requires all three arrays (`keys`, `buttons`,
`axes`), at least one key and at least one button or axis. Key identities are case-sensitive Godot
`Key` enum names (for example `I`, `F1`, `Space`, `Escape`); `None` and standalone modifier keys
`Shift`/`Ctrl`/`Alt`/`Meta` are rejected, and key chords are not part of version1. Button identities
are the names in the table plus `Start`, `LeftStick` and `RightStick`. Signed axis identities
are `LeftX-`, `LeftX+`, `LeftY-`, `LeftY+`, `RightX-`, `RightX+`, `RightY-`, `RightY+`.
Unknown fields/actions/identities, conflicting bindings, missing device access and invalid values
produce `ContentError: invalid-input-settings` before a session is published. A missing or unreadable
explicit file also fails; it never silently restores defaults. No file selects documented defaults.
Settings are loaded once at startup; there is no in-game settings UI or automatic settings save.

Adjustable text uses the actual Label's visible-character count. Time reveals characters but never
submits a gameplay command. Confirm while text is incomplete reveals the rest and preserves the real
wait token; a subsequent Confirm acknowledges. A choice with incomplete text likewise reveals first
and still requires a semantic Yes/No input. Instant text displays everything and still awaits its
normal acknowledgement and choice. A completed reveal cannot complete a presentation cue.

Reduced-flash keeps white FadeOut/FadeIn overlay opacity at0 for the same service duration. It still
submits `CompletePresentation` with the reached token and cue kind. Black fades and other services
retain their existing behavior. This intentional visual deviation, logical remapping and modern text
progression belong to ADR0010 9A/10A; they do not establish original visual/timing parity or 8C/H4.

### Native 9A observation

After the locked environment and Debug adapter build, select a fresh ignored output directory. The
bounded external observer writes an authored variation/settings into the specified destinations,
then instantiates ordinary `Main.tscn` with those actual startup arguments. It never sets session
state. It adds white presentation cues, a second spell, ordinary physical definitions/rewards and
an adjacent durable opponent to the selected existing authored world.

```powershell
$env:SF2_INPUT_CASE = 'keyboard' # gamepad, remapped-keyboard, remapped-gamepad
$env:SF2_INPUT_VARIANT = 'harbor' # hill exercises another world, actor and spellbook
$env:SF2_INPUT_RATE = '20'       # also observe80 with the hill variation
$env:SF2_EXPLORATION_OBSERVATION_OUTPUT = Join-Path $env:SF2_RUN_OUTPUT 'input.json'
$package = Join-Path $env:SF2_RUN_OUTPUT 'input-package.json'
$settings = Join-Path $env:SF2_RUN_OUTPUT 'input-settings.json'
$arguments = @('--headless', '--path', 'remake/game', '--fixed-fps', '60',
    '--script', 'res://probes/engine_input_accessibility_observation.gd', '--',
    '--authored-package', $package)
if ($env:SF2_INPUT_CASE.StartsWith('remapped-')) { $arguments += @('--input-settings', $settings) }
& $godotBinary @arguments
```

The remapped cases replace every action binding, move stick input to the right stick, swap the
Confirm/Cancel convention and select reduced-flash/adjustable text. Require `passed:true`, empty
failures and clean process errors. Observe actual field movement, decline/re-prompt/acceptance,
partial/full text reveal with retained waits, both real completed white cue tokens, the same session
at first battle control, movement/cancel, two spells, another allied target, actual HEAL, another
actor's Stay, next-round attack and binding-derived help. Gamepad cases also check repeated axis
values, unrelated trigger events and release edges against the actual session revision/preview.
Compare default keyboard/gamepad and remapped harbor outputs at the matching semantic checkpoints:
flags, actor, round, resources, seeds and white token/kind completion must agree; only the intended
presentation/settings differ. The hill case checks independent valid content rather than a fixed
receipt sequence. Default white opacity reaches1; reduced-flash stays0.

For the current private continuous outcome/return observation, reuse the existing private selection,
R1 start and opening navigation setup from [exploration reproduction](field-programs.md#reproduction).
Select `SF2_INPUT_CASE=private-remapped-gamepad`, `SF2_BATTLE_OUTCOME_CASE=victory`, and the new observer
script, with `--private-exploration-start <selected-R1-start> --input-settings <ignored-settings-path>`.
It reuses the existing actual-input outcome driver, including its single-frame input cadence, with
all commands mapped to the remapped/swapped gamepad. This case uses instant text and ordinary flashes;
the authored cases own the paired accessibility comparison. Require the existing main/admission/
outcome reports to pass through usable return movement, retained session identity and valid node
projection. The settings startup matrix uses the existing `engine_battle_observation.gd` startup
case with EXPECT_FAILURE=`invalid-input-settings`; require no session/actors/RNG on rejected input.
Each launch tests an actual startup configuration in the retained project/installation; no editor,
project copy, screenshot, original emulator, reference replay or test of the observer is needed.
